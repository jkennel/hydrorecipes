\usage{
step_make_regular(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  delta = 1,
  start = NULL,
  prefix = "make_regular_",
  columns = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("make_regular")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables
for this step. See \code{\link[recipes:selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from
the original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{delta}{A single numeric. This is the spacing for the regular series.}

\item{start}{A single numeric or value that can be converted to numeric. The
starting value of the regular series.  If left blank it defaults to the
minimum value.}

\item{prefix}{A prefix for generated column names, default to "lag_lead_".}

\item{columns}{A character string of variable names that will
be populated (eventually) by the \code{terms} argument.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of recipe with the new step added to the sequence
of any existing operations.
}
\description{
\code{step_make_regular} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
will generate an regularly spaced column.
}
\details{
This step sorts the data and converts a column to a regular series.
No interpolation is done and \code{NA} values are inserted where there is no
matching time.

\examples{
data(wipp30)
nrow(wipp30)
wipp30_missing <- wipp30[-(2:10),]

  step_make_regular(time) |>
