step_distributed_lag(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  knots = NULL,
  basis_mat = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables
for this step. See \code{\link[recipes:selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from
the original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{knots}{An integer vector of breakpoints to define the spline. These should
include the \code{Boundary.knots}. See \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splines}{splines}
for more info.}

\item{basis_mat}{The matrix of basis kernels to convolve. This is
\code{NULL} until computed by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}. This can also be specified as an
object generated from the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splines}{splines} or \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splines2}{splines2} packages having attributes
for \code{knots} and \code{Boundary.knots}. If specified like this \code{knots} will be
obtained from the \code{basis_mat} and not from the \code{knots} parameter.}

\item{spline_fun}{Function used for calculating \code{basis_mat}.  This should
return an object having \code{knots} and \code{Boundary.knots} attributes.}

\item{n_subset}{A single integer. Subset every \code{n_subset} values.}

\item{n_shift}{A single integer amount to shift results in number of observations.}

\item{options}{The arguments to pass to \code{spline_fun}.}

\item{prefix}{A prefix for generated column names, defaults to "distributed_lag_".}

\item{keep_original_cols}{A logical to keep the original variables in the
output. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{columns}{A character string of variable names that will
be populated elsewhere.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of recipe with the new step added to the sequence
of any existing operations.

\description{
\code{step_distributed_lag} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that
will add new basis lag columns. The new data will
include NA values up to the maximum lag. These can be removed
with \code{\link[recipes:step_naomit]{recipes::step_naomit()}}. The inspiration for this step comes from the
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlnm}{dlnm package}. For large datasets
with large maximum time lags, convolution is
done in the frequency domain for efficiency. Samples should be ordered and
have regular spacing (i.e. regular time series, regular spatial sampling).
}
\details{
This step assumes that the data are already \emph{in the proper sequential
order} for lagging. The input should be sampled at a regular interval
(time, space, etc.). When the recipe is baked a set of vectors resulting from
the convolution of a vector and a basis matrix is returned. Distributed lags
can be used to model a delayed response to a input
in a flexible manner with fewer regressor terms. The method achieves this by
convolving a input stress with a basis lag matrix (commonly spline function)
which leads to a set of regressors with fewer terms but still capable of
describing both fast and slow responses.
