\usage{
be_visual(
  dat,
  dep = "wl",
  ind = "baro",
  time = "datetime",
  be_tests = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
  inverse = TRUE,
  subsample = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data that has the independent and dependent variables (data.table)}

\item{dep}{name of the dependent variable column (character).  This is
typically the name for the column holding your water level data.}

\item{ind}{name of the independent variable column (character).  This is
typically the name for the column holding your barometric pressure data.}

\item{time}{name of the column containing the time (character)}

\item{be_tests}{vector of barometric efficiencies to test (between 0 and 1) (numeric)}

\item{inverse}{whether the barometric relationship is inverse
(TRUE means that when the barometric pressure goes up the measured water
level goes down (vented transducer, depth to water), FALSE means that when
the barometric pressure goes up so does the measured pressure
(non-vented transducer)) (logical).}

\item{subsample}{should the data be subsampled for plotting? (logical)}
}
\value{
data.table of barometric efficiency compensated datasets
}
\description{
Generate dataset for comparing barometric efficiency
}
\examples{
library(data.table)
be <- 0.43
x <- seq(0, 28*pi, pi / (12*12))

baro <- sin(x) + rnorm(length(x), sd = 0.04)
wl <- -sin(x) * be + rnorm(length(x), sd = 0.04)
dat <- data.table(datetime = as.POSIXct(x * 86400 / (2 * pi),
                                        origin = '1970-01-01', tz = 'UTC'),
                  wl = wl, baro = baro)
