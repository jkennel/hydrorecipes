\item{dat}{data that has the independent and dependent variables (data.table)}

\item{dep}{name of the dependent variable column (character).  This is
typically the name for the column holding your water level data.}

typically the name for the column holding your barometric pressure data.}

\item{return_model}{whether to return the lm model or just the barometric/loading
efficiency (logical).#'}
}
\value{
barometric efficiency calculated by least squares
}
